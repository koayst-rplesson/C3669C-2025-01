    "## RAGAs Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice RAGAs metrics using a dataset tailored for the financial domain. `FiQA` dataset is designed for financial question-answering and recommendation tasks, making it suitable for RAG evaluations.\n",
    "- FiQA contains financial questions and answers, a domain that often requires precise retrieval and factual consistency.\n",
    "- It has annotated data that can help you test retrieval and generation accuracy.\n",
    "- Financial data typically requires contextual understanding, making it a good test for RAG models.\n",
    "- A sub dataset called `rag_eval` (part of FiQA dataset) contains contexts field. This field is necessary for obtaining metrics like context recall and context precision."

What is fair is whatever you folks agree is fair. Just make sure to get it nailed down in writing and signed by all the parties, so you don't risk someone changing their minds later.Question (which you need to ask yourself): How well are your friends paid for their work? What would happen if you just took your money and bought a garage, and hired two car mechanics? How would that be different from what you are doing?

      "\"The best answer here is \"\"maybe, but probably not\"\". A few quick reasons: Its not a bad idea to watch other investors especially those who can move markets but do your own research on an investment first. Your sole reason for investing should not be \"\"Warren did it\"\".\"I think following the professional money managers is a strategy worth considering. The buys from your favorite investors can be taken as strong signals. But you should never buy any stock blindly just because someone else bought it. Be sure do your due diligence before the purchase. The most important question is not what they bought, but why they bought it and how much. To add/comment on Freiheit's points:\n",

It is important to do your own research and due diligence before investing in any stock, and not just blindly follow what someone else has done. It is important to understand why they bought the stock and how much they bought, and to think independently and carefully when making any investment decisions.\n",

      "If your employer has closed and you need to transfer your 401k funds, you should contact the HR department of your former employer to get the necessary paperwork and instructions for the transfer. Depending on the plan, you may be able to transfer the funds to another 401k plan, such as the 401k plan of your new employer, or you may need to transfer the funds to an IRA. If you transfer the funds to an IRA, you will have more investment options and may be able to reduce the overhead fees associated with the account. Additionally, transferring the funds to an IRA will allow you to condense your 401k accounts over time and avoid any issues if your employer goes out of business.\n",

      "\"I'm afraid the great myth of limited liability companies is that all such vehicles have instant access to credit.  Limited liability on a company with few physical assets to underwrite the loan, or with insufficient revenue, will usually mean that the owners (or others) will be asked to stand surety on any credit. However, there is a particular form of \"\"credit\"\" available to businesses on terms with their clients.  It is called factoring. Factoring is a financial transaction   whereby a business sells its accounts   receivable (i.e., invoices) to a third   party (called a factor) at a discount   in exchange for immediate money with   which to finance continued business.   Factoring differs from a bank loan in   three main ways. First, the emphasis   is on the value of the receivables   (essentially a financial asset), not   the firm’s credit worthiness.   Secondly, factoring is not a loan – it   is the purchase of a financial asset   (the receivable). Finally, a bank loan   involves two parties whereas factoring   involves three. Recognise that this can be quite expensive.  Most banks catering to small businesses will offer some form of factoring service, or will know of services that offer it.  It isn't that different from cheque encashment services (pay-day services) where you offer a discount on future income for money now. An alternative is simply to ask his clients if they'll pay him faster if he offers a discount (since either of interest payments or factoring would reduce profitability anyway).\"Banks will usually look at 2 years worth of tax returns for issuing business credit.  If those aren't available (for instance, for recently formed businesses), they will look at the personal returns of the owners. Unfortunately, it sounds like your friend is in the latter category. Bringing in another partner isn't necessarily going to help, either; with only two partners / owners, the bank would probably look at both owners' personal tax returns and credit histories.  It may be necessary to offer collateral. I'm sorry I can't offer any better solutions, but alternative funding such as personal loans from family & friends could be necessary.  Perhaps making them partners in exchange for capital.\n",
